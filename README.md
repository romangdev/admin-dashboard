# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS

This admin dashboard was created using pure HTML5 and CSS3 with no additional frameworks or preprocesseros.

# Optimizations
If given more time to the project, I would move on to add in some Javascript interactivity, possibly in the form of reponsive buttons, links, and the profile images. Any further optimizations I'd like to do would require some back end work so that things like the individual announcements on the annoucement card can be updated and stored. 

# Lessons Learned:
This admin dashboard mockup was built mainly to practice CSS grid, especially in conjunction with using Flexbox. There is major disagreement amongst the frontend community about when and where each method should be used. So I took it upon myself to build this dashboard and start working on reaching my own conclusions on how I can use both Grid and Flexbox in tandem to handle individual problems I encounter.
